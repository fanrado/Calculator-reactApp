# About me
I am Rado Razakamiandra, a beginner in front end development. I just learn the basics of React so this is how I apply it.

# Description
This basic calculator is my first application with ReactJS.
It presents essentially the basic use of state. I wanted to be sure that with jsx and a bit of css, we can have a good looking app.
